"From YouTube API to Predictive Analytics: Comprehensive Data Analytics and Predictive Modeling for Video Performance Optimization"


This project explores a comprehensive approach to enhancing video performance through advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. After Scrapping the data from the Youtube Channel "VJ Sidhu Vlogs" and Created a CSV file for futhur analysis. By integrating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, and a suite of predictive modelsâ€”including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks this uncover key drivers of video engagement. The project includes rigorous hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and feature importance assessment to optimize model performance and extract actionable insights. These integrated efforts provide a robust framework for understanding and optimizing video content strategies, ultimately aiming to increase viewer engagement and success.
